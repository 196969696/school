<p class="text">There is currently one person working on this, and that's me. I am a honor student that wishes to work harder in the upcoming year and get into many extracurricular programs in order to get into the NJHS. This society/club was meant to inspire, help, and introduce students to honor programs such as NJHS.</p></div>
