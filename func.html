<p class="text">This society works as an afterschool club. It provides resources, activities, and community service in order to get into NJHS. The NJHS application requires students to participate in extracurricular activites, leadership and team-building activites, and community service. The club helps you participate in all of that and gives some resources to help you with that. The resources we will provide contains information about where and how to do all of that and helps you write the essay for the application.</p></div>
